This project combines technologies we learned during the object-oriented
programming course (C++ and SFML) as well as technologies we
learned independently (JavaScript and Firebase).

Since this is an educational project, we are not required to submit together
with the server then the server side is not included in the package.

## Game Download
To run the game you need to download [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php).
We use SFML 2.5.1 version.

The project includes boost library.

## Prerequisites
